## Download the Boilerplate

You can extend or customize the functionality of Contentstack CMS with Marketplace apps. To simplify and speed up the building process, boilerplates describe repetitive elements in a project. This boilerplate will help you build custom applications for your organization or stack.

Download the [boilerplate](https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt23180bf2502c7444/blt2bccdd28a2d44d1b/62fcb522da3c526fe6314886/app-boilerplate.zip?disposition=download).

## UI Locations and Examples

UI Locations allow you to extend Contentstack's functionality. Through these UI locations, you can customize Contentstack's default behavior and UI. Integration of third-party applications is possible using different UI locations.

The Contentstack App SDK currently supports the following UI Locations:

-   [Custom Field Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/custom-field-location)
-   [Dashboard Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/dashboard-location)
-   [Asset Sidebar Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/asset-sidebar-location)
-   [App Config Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/app-config-location)
-   [RTE Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/rte-location)
-   [Sidebar Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/sidebar-location)
-   [Field Modifier Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/field-modifier-location/)
-   [Full Page Location](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/full-page-location)

### Custom Field Location

Custom Field Location allows you to create custom fields that can be used in your content types. You can integrate with various business applications, such as [Bynder](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/marketplace-apps/bynder), [Cloudinary](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/marketplace-apps/cloudinary), [Shopify](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/marketplace-apps/shopify), by adding them as a custom field to your stack's content type.

### Dashboard Location

With the Dashboard Location, you can create widgets for your stack dashboard. Integration with [Google Analytics](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/marketplace-apps/google-analytics/) provides meaningful insights about your website.

### Asset Sidebar Location

Using the Asset Sidebar Location, you can create customized sidebar widgets to extend the functionality of your assets.

Manage, transform, and optimize your stack's assets efficiently using the [Image Preset Builder](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/marketplace-apps/image-preset-builder).

### App Config Location

App Config UI Location allows you to manage all the app settings centrally. Once configured, all other locations (where the app is installed) can access these settings.

### RTE Location

The RTE Location allows you to create custom plugins to expand the functionality of your JSON Rich Text Editor. Using the Audience and Variables plugin, you can tailor your content as per your requirements.

### Sidebar Location

The Sidebar Location provides powerful tools for analyzing and recommending ideas for your entry. Use the [Smartling](https://help.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/4865477629083) sidebar location to help translate your content.

### Field Modifier Location

The Field Modifier Location is a type of UI location which extends the capabilities of entry fields. With the Field Modifier UI location, you can allow the different apps to appear on defined field data types such as Text, Number, JSON, Boolean, File, Reference fields etc.

### Full Page Location

The Full Page location is a type of UI location that lets you view full page apps such as [Release Preview](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/marketplace-apps/release-preview) within your stack.

## Using Contentstack styles

Install the Venus UI library package to style your app according to the Contentstack UI:

```sh
npm i @contentstack/venus-components --save
```
